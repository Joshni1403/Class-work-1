**OOP (Object - Oriented Programming)**

WHAT IS OOP?

The *Object-Oriented Programming* (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are instances of classes. These objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods), enabling modular, reusable, and scalable software design. OOP emphasizes principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to promote efficient code organization and maintainability.

What are the main three buiding blocks of OOPs?

The OOPs consists of three factors; Class, Objects, Methods


*   **Class**: Classes are similar to economic models where those are certain structures which are blue print to create objects. A class is a blueprint or template used to define the structure and behavior of objects, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions). It does not hold any data itself but serves as a model for creating actual instances.
*   **Objects**: Objects are the specific applications to those theories. An object is a real, working instance of a class that contains its own copy of the class’s attributes and can perform actions defined by its methods. Each object can have unique data, even if it's created from the same class.
*   **Methods**: Methods are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors or actions an object can perform, often interacting with the object’s internal data. They help in organizing code and enabling object-specific operations.
